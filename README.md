# 🧠 AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard

This project is part of my internship at **FutureInterns**, and it showcases a complete end-to-end solution for predicting and visualizing future sales using **Machine Learning (Prophet)** and **Power BI**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to forecast monthly sales using historical transaction data and present the results through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard enables users to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and regional profitability.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📈 Monthly Sales Forecasting using Facebook Prophet
- 📊 Interactive Power BI Dashboard with 4 analytical pages:
  - **Overview Dashboard** – Key KPIs and forecast trend
  - **Customer Analysis** – Sales and profit by customer
  - **Region & Time Analysis** – Sales by region and date
  - **Forecast Analysis** - Predciting Future Sales Trend
- 📤 Exported ML predictions for seamless Power BI integration
- 🧹 Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, DAX (Power BI)
- **Libraries:** pandas, Prophet, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The machine learning part focuses on **time-series forecasting** using Facebook Prophet, a model that works well with trend and seasonality-based datasets.

- **Model:** Facebook Prophet
- **Training:** Model trained on monthly aggregated sales data
- **Evaluation:** R² Score and visual inspection of forecast curve
- **Integration:** Forecasted output saved to CSV for Power BI consumption
